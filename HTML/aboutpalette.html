            My name is Mr. Lorem. I am 78 years old, and I’ve spent more than six decades behind a camera, chasing light and shadow in all their fleeting, poetic forms. While the world around me has changed in color, pace, and tone, I have remained rooted in the timeless clarity of black and white photography.<br> <br>Monochrome has always spoken to me in a language color never could. It strips away distraction and reveals the soul of a scene—the raw emotion in a face, the elegance of form, the weight of silence, the power of contrast. For me, photography is not about documenting what is seen, but what is felt. A moment suspended in silver tones tells a deeper truth.<br><br>My journey began in my late teens, in the darkroom of my father’s home, where I first watched an image slowly appear in a tray of developer. I was hooked from the very first print. Over the years, I’ve traveled extensively—urban alleyways, abandoned houses, quiet forests, old train stations, bustling markets—always looking for stories carved in light.<br><br>Now, in the quieter stretch of life, I find even more beauty in the stillness. I walk slower, notice more, and frame with greater intention. My camera is an old friend—worn, trusted, and always patient. I still shoot with film whenever I can, hand-process my work, and believe there’s something sacred in waiting for a photograph to emerge.<br><br>This collection is a reflection of the moments I’ve found and the ones that found me. It’s not about perfection—it’s about presence. I hope, through these black and white frames, you see what I saw. Or better yet, what I felt.<br><br>Thank you for stopping by.<br><br>– Mr. Lorem
